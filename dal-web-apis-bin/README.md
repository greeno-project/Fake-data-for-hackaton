# DAL WEB APIs Documentation

This bundle provides REST and WebSocket access to Devices, Functions and Events available in OSGi Device Abstraction Layer

REST APIs are used to provide access to Device and Function services. Functions operations invoke and FunctionData editing is implemented using Java Reflection. 
WebSocket APIs provides a publish/subscribe service built upon OSGi EventAdmin 

##Interacting with REST APIs

Remember: Content-type must be set to "application/json" when a json is sent to the server 

### Getting devices list

Using this request, you can retrieve a list of all the available devices.
For every device, among other info, there is the indication of the device unique ID, which
can be used to directly access to the device and the indication of the device driver (ZigBee, Bluetooth, etc.).


#### HTTP request:
```
GET http://host:port/api/devices/
```
Example Request:
```
GET http://localhost/api/devices
```
Example Response:
```
[
    {
        "dal.device.status": 2,
        "dal.device.UID": "ZigBee:test123",
        "dal.device.driver": "ZigBee",
        "service.id": 28,
        "objectClass": [
            "org.osgi.service.dal.Device"
        ]
    }
]
```


### Getting device functions

This API is used to retrieve the list of the available functions supported by the device. For
example a Smart Plug has two functions: one to retrieve the energy consumption and another 
"boolean" function useful to change the status of the smart plug (ON/OFF). Every function
indicates the id, which can be used to access directly the function and the list of the operation
that can be invoked on the function.

#### HTTP request:
```
GET http://host:port/api/devices/${device_uid}/functions
```
Example Request:
```
GET http://localhost/api/devices/ZigBee:test123/functions
```
Example Response:
```
[
    {
        "CLASS": "ismb.pert.jemma.dummydevice.DummyFunction",
        "dal.function.device.UID": "ZigBee:test123",
        "service.id": 27,
        "dal.function.UID": "ZigBee:test123:testButton",
        "objectClass": [
            "org.osgi.service.dal.Function"
        ],
        "dal.function.operation.names": [
            "getData",
            "reverse",
            "setFalse",
            "setTrue"
        ]
    }
]
```

###Invoking operations

In order to invoke an operation on a function, you would use the function uri (http://host:port/functions/${function_uid}) and send an HTTP POST with the operation in the request body as application/json.
Hereafter, some example of operations invoked (the first one with a result returned).

### Getting data from a device button
#### HTTP request:
```
POST http://host:port/api/functions/${function_uid}
```
Example Request:
```
POST http://localhost/api/functions/ZigBee:test123:testButton

{"operation":"getData"}

```
Example Response:
```
{"value":false,"timestamp":1409234704982}
```

### Setting true the device button
#### HTTP request:
```
POST http://host:port/api/functions/${function_uid}
```
Example Request:
```
POST http://localhost/api/functions/ZigBee:test123:testButton

{"operation":"setTrue"}

```
Example Response:
```
{"code":200}
```




### Setting false the device button
#### HTTP request:
```
POST http://host:port/api/functions/${function_uid}
```
Example Request:
```
POST http://localhost/api/functions/ZigBee:test123:testButton

{"operation":"getData"}

```
Example Response:
```
{"code":200,"result":{"value":false,"timestamp":1410111194964}}
```

Or in case of error:

```
{"code":404,"message":"Function not found"}

```

or

```
{"code":500,"message":"Error invoking operation"}
```


### Setting a value for a function (e.g. LevelControl)
#### HTTP request:
```
POST http://host:port/api/functions/${function_uid}
```
Example Request:
```
POST http://localhost/functions/ZigBee:test123:testButton

{"operation":"setData",
"arguments": 
[
{"type":"java.math.BigDecimal","value":1}
]
}

```
Example Response:
```
{"code":200}
```

Or in case of error:

```
{"code":404,"message":"Function not found"}

```

or

```
{"code":500,"message":"Error invoking operation"}
```
 
 
 
 
## Subscribing to events using WebSockets
 
 The Websocket address to be specified is:
 
 ```
 ws://host:port/ws
 ```
 
 Once the WebSocket connection have been set-up, the system expects a json object describing subscriptions to events.
 
 This example shows a message to be sent to the server if you want to subscribe to events related
 to function "ZigBee:SmartPlug1:OnOff" and property "data"
  
 ```
 {"dal.function.UID":"ZigBee:SmartPlug1:OnOff","dal.function.property.name":"data"}
 ```
 
  Wildcards (\*) are accepted! So you can subscribe to all events coming from every function sending the screen below
  
 ```
 {"dal.function.UID":"*","dal.function.property.name":"*"}
 ```
 
 or you can subscribe to all events coming froma specific device
 
 ```
 {"dal.function.UID":"ZigBee:SmartPlug1:*","dal.function.property.name":"*"}
 ```
 
 
 Every time you specify a subscription string over the same connection, older subscriptions on the same connection are cancelled.
 
 If you specify an invalid subscription string, the connection will be closed and an error will be reported
 
 Events matching the specified filters will be written by the server on this WebSocket connection, like in the example below:
 
 
 ```
 {"topic":"org/osgi/service/dal/FunctionEvent/PROPERTY_CHANGED","properties":{"dal.function.UID":"ZigBee:SmartPlug1:OnOff","dal.function.property.value":{"value":false,"timestamp":1410703590988},"dal.function.property.name":"data"}}
 ```
